# McDonalds-website-clone
I have successfully created a clone of McDonald's Pakistan's website using HTML and CSS. This project aimed to replicate the look and feel of the original site while maintaining a responsive design that works across various screen sizes. From the homepage design, including the iconic McDonald's color scheme, to the navigation bar, and footer elements, every detail has been carefully recreated to ensure that the clone mirrors the original site's visual aesthetics.

The project involved implementing various CSS techniques to style the different sections of the website. I used flexbox and grid to ensure a seamless layout, ensuring that all content is perfectly aligned and responsive. I focused on replicating the banners, product displays, and menu sections in detail, making sure that each element was styled to closely match the original site. Additionally, hover effects were added to buttons and menu items to enhance the user experience, similar to the real McDonald's site.

Completing this McDonald's clone has allowed me to strengthen my frontend development skills, particularly in responsive design, CSS animations, and media queries. The project provided valuable insight into the structure of a commercial website and how to replicate it using only HTML and CSS. This clone demonstrates my ability to recreate professional, pixel-perfect designs from scratch, which is essential for modern web development.
